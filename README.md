# Cassandra UI Tool

A comprehensive web-based monitoring and management tool for Apache Cassandra clusters, specifically designed for monitoring Temporal service datastores.

## Features

### üîç Monitoring Features
- **Real-time cluster topology visualization** - View your cluster's physical and logical structure
- **Performance metrics dashboard** - Monitor read/write latency, throughput, and error rates
- **Storage and compaction monitoring** - Track data growth and compaction operations
- **Node health tracking** - Monitor individual node status and availability
- **Live operation monitoring** - Track ongoing maintenance operations

### ‚öôÔ∏è Operational Features
- **Dynamic cluster connection** - Connect to any Cassandra cluster at runtime without restarts
- **Connection management** - Save, edit, and switch between multiple cluster configurations
- **Repair operations** - Run full and incremental repairs on keyspaces
- **Compaction management** - Trigger and monitor compaction operations
- **Node operations** - Cleanup, scrub, and flush operations
- **Keyspace management** - Create and drop keyspaces with proper replication
- **CQL query execution** - Execute queries with configurable consistency levels
- **Schema exploration** - Browse keyspaces, tables, and data structures

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Material-UI, and Recharts
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: Cassandra Driver for Node.js
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSockets for live metric updates
- **Visualization**: Custom charts and cluster topology diagrams

## Prerequisites

1. **Apache Cassandra** cluster running and accessible
2. **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
3. **npm** or **yarn** package manager
4. **nodetool** available in your PATH (for administrative operations)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies for both frontend and backend
npm run install:all
```

### 2. Start the Application

```bash
# Development mode (both frontend and backend)
npm run dev

# Or start them separately:
npm run dev:backend  # Backend only
npm run dev:frontend # Frontend only
```

### 3. Access the UI

Open your browser and navigate to: **http://localhost:3000**

### 4. Configure Cassandra Connection

The application now supports **dynamic cluster connection management**:

1. **Auto-connection on startup** (optional): If environment variables are set in `backend/.env`, the backend will attempt to connect automatically
2. **Manual connection via UI**: Use the connection management interface to connect to any Cassandra cluster on demand
3. **Multiple cluster support**: Save and switch between different cluster configurations
4. **Runtime connection changes**: Connect and disconnect without restarting the application

To configure auto-connection, create `backend/.env` file:

```bash
# Optional: Auto-connect on startup
CASSANDRA_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,192.168.1.100
CASSANDRA_PORT=9042
CASSANDRA_DC=datacenter1
CASSANDRA_USERNAME=
CASSANDRA_PASSWORD=

# Application Configuration
PORT=3001
REFRESH_INTERVAL=5000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CASSANDRA_HOSTS` | Comma-separated list of Cassandra nodes | `127.0.0.1` |
| `CASSANDRA_PORT` | Cassandra native protocol port | `9042` |

3. **API Integration**: Update `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
4. **Types**: Add TypeScript interfaces in `frontend/src/types/`

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
1. Verify Cassandra is running: `nodetool status`
2. Check network connectivity to Cassandra nodes
3. Verify authentication credentials if using auth
4. Check datacenter name matches your cluster configuration

### Performance Issues
1. Reduce `REFRESH_INTERVAL` if updates are too frequent
2. Monitor WebSocket connection stability
3. Check Cassandra cluster performance

### Operation Failures
1. Ensure `nodetool` is available in PATH
2. Verify user permissions for cluster operations
3. Check cluster health before running operations

## Security Notes

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
